  "recipeIngredient": [
    "300 g long-grain rice (like Basmati)",
    "300 g potatoes (about 2 medium), peeled and diced",
    "150 g onion (1 large), finely chopped",
    "250 g tomatoes (2 large), chopped",
    "20 g garlic (4-5 cloves), minced",
    "3 tbsp Sunflower Oil",
    "1 tsp Cumin Seeds",
    "1 tsp Turmeric Powder",
    "1/2 tsp freshly ground Black Pepper",
    "1.5 tsp Salt (or to taste)",
    "600 ml Water"
  ],
  "recipeInstructions": [
    "Rinse the rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Set aside.",
    "Heat the sunflower oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the cumin seeds and let them sizzle for about 30 seconds until fragrant.",
    "Add the finely chopped onions and minced garlic. Sauté for 3-4 minutes until the onions become translucent and soft.",
    "Add the diced potatoes and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until they begin to soften slightly.",
    "Stir in the chopped tomatoes, turmeric powder, black pepper, and salt. Cook for another 4-5 minutes, until the tomatoes break down and form a thick, pulpy sauce.",
    "Add the rinsed rice to the pot and gently stir for one minute to coat the grains with the spice mixture.",
    "Pour in the 600 ml of water and bring the mixture to a rolling boil.",
    "Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid, and let it simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until all the water is absorbed and the rice is fully cooked. Do not lift the lid during this time.",
    "Turn off the heat and let the pot stand, still covered, for at least 5-10 minutes. This allows the rice to steam and become fluffy.",
    "Gently fluff the rice with a fork before serving hot."
